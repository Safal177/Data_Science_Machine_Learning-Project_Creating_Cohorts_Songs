# Data_Science_Machine_Learning Project_Creating_Cohorts_Songs

# Project Objective:
The goal of this project is to analyze “Spotify song data” associated with the rolling stones’ albums and then find cohorts of songs depending on their audio features. By doing exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, and then clustering, the main aim is to find trends in song characteristics, evaluate connections between popularity and audio features, and make song clusters which is used for music recommendations. 

# Dataset:
My project worked on the dataset “rolling_stones_spotify.csv” obtained from the MS AI Machine Learning using Python with Python program with Simplilearn.

# Data analysis file:
All steps are mentioned into this “csv” file, Data_Science_Machine_Learning Project_Creating_Cohorts_Songs.csv

# Analysis Steps: 
1.	Initial Data Inspection and Cleaning:   
    Find missing values, duplicate values, and unnecessary features 
    Cleaned the dataset
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering:
     Find popular albums using visualized features
     Get correlations between popularity and song features 
     Use dimensionality reduction method for better visualization.
3. Cluster Analysis: 
   Get the maximum number of clusters.  
   Used K-Means clustering to make group songs.  
    Group clusters with audio characteristics and popularity.
   
# Conclusion:
The data analysis showed different groups of songs which were formed with clustering concerned on factors such as “danceability”, “energy”, “acousticness”, “valence” and “popularity”. EDA demonstrated how song popularity is guided through various features and then discovered albums with popular records. Dimensionality reduction (PCA) supported clear visualization of clusters, while K-Means clustering with 2 clusters grouped songs into significant cohorts. These clusters provide some platforms like Spotify recommend songs used for user dedication.
